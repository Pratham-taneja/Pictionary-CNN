This is a dataset that contains 340 classes, each class has more than a lakh data points. 

My goal is to reverse engineer the doodle game by using deep learning and javascript.

The model that I have used to train on this dataset is a Convolutional Neural Network. CNNs are one among the few Deep learning model that are able work really well with image data.
